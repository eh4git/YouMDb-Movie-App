# YouMDb Entertainment Application

## Description
This application was built to provide internet users with a centralized location to look up information on movies and to be presented with movie trailers and similar movie recommendations. Motivation behind this application stems from a change in lifestyle for many people due to the pandemic that tends to include more time enjoying movies. This serves to accommodate the increase in demand for movies by providing users with information pertaining to movies of interest. 

This project was a great exercise in utilizing multiple entertainment API's to present the user with useful information relevant to the scope of the application. Additionally, building this application helped reinforce our skills with jquery, HTML, and CSS. 

## Usage

TasteDive API - Provides movie recommendations
